A fun fact about Toronto is that a lot of popular TV shows and movies are filmed in Toronto, even if they do not take place in Toronto. Some notable examples include Suicide Squard, Good Will Hunting, Room, and the 2001 Mariah Carey musical Glitter. The University of Toronto is also frequent filming location â€” trailers and crews can often be seen around campus (Fun fact: the famous "the limit does not exist" scene in Mean Girls, which was filmed in Convocation Hall).  

In the following visualization, I take a look at how critic and fan responses on IMDb compare for different movies filmed in Toronto. The data comes from IMBd and the list of movies filmed in Toronto comes from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_shot_in_Toronto). I adjusted my comparison to account for the fact critics, on average, give lower ratings than fans. So, for example, a rating of 4.94 from critics and a 6.28 from fans would be considered as agreement between the two parties.

Critics and fans generally agree on the best and worst films. Sadly, not even Mariah's most devout fans could find any redemptive qualities in Glitter. Another musical movie, Hairspray was received more positively by critics than fans, which is surprising for a musical. On the flip side, Half Baked, starring Dave Chappelle was considered above average by fans, but did not even warrant a rating of 2 from critics. 

Oscar nominations and wins were also consistently awarded to fans that were beloved by critics and fans alike. Suicide Squad and Silver Streak were a couple of notable exceptions, but they were nominated for non-acting categories.
