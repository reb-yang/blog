# Hi, I'm Rebecca :wave:

I'm a third-year statistics student at the University of Toronto. I also dabble in art history. 

## Books :book:

Sometimes I read books. Here are some that I liked in 2020:

- *Eat a Peach*, by David Change and Gabe Ulla
- *Open*, by Andre Agassi
- *Know My Name*, by Chanel Miller
